# The Rabin Engine

## Beta Testing in Progress
We are offering %5 extra credit for students who participate in the beta rollout this semester.

## How to Participate:
1. Create a GitHub account using YOUR DIGIPEN EMAIL as the primary email address and YOUR FULL NAME or DIGIPEN USERNAME as the username. We must be able to tell who you are in the class simply by looking at the username and email of the github account.
2. Download/Clone this repository.
3. Complete the project as stated in the project rubric.
4. Submit AT LEAST 1 issue including feedback, bugs encountered, and a brief description of your experience in the Issues tab of this repository.

Extra credit will only be given to those students who follow each of these steps.
Extra credit given cannot push your grade past %100. 

### DO NOT SHARE THIS REPO WITH STUDENTS OUTSIDE OF THE CLASS OR DIGIPEN

For any questions or concerns, feel free to contact TA's Cole or Robert.
